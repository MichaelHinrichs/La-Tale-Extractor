# La Tale Extractor
A tool to extract the contents of SPF files from the MMO La Tale, and it's successor [La Tale - Evolved](https://store.steampowered.com/app/721030).</br>
Drag and drop one onto the application.

Unfortunately, the original release is no longer avalible for purchase on steam.</br>
If you have it in your library, you can still reinstall it with steam://install/264360/.

If you want to extract from both versions of La Tale, please either move or rename one game folder before installing the other one, or install them to different drives. La Tale - Evolved is displayed on the store page, and installed, simply as "La Tale".</br>
If you try to install both versions without doing this, the second game's files will overwrite the first.</br>
This can be fixed by uninstalling both versions, and reinstalling them while following this paragraph's advice.
